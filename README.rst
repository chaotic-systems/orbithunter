orbithunter 0.5rc1
==================
orbithunter serves as a framework for solving chaotic nonlinear partial differential equations.

Features
--------

- An object oriented approach to solutions of partial differential equations
- A general-purpose framework for finding, visualizing and manipulating these solutions
- High-level access to SciPy API, particularly its minimize and optimize packages.
- New spatiotemporal techniques such as 'clipping' and 'gluing'

Currently there is only an implementation of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation (KSE).
