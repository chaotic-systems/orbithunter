orbithunter v0.5b1 (Beta)
===========================
orbithunter serves as a framework for solving chaotic nonlinear partial differential equations.

.. _PhD thesis: https://github.com/mgudorf/orbithunter/tree/main/docs/spatiotemporal_tiling_of_the_KSe.pdf

Features
--------

- An object oriented approach to solutions of partial differential equations
- A general-purpose framework for finding, visualizing and manipulating these solutions
- High-level access to SciPy API, particularly its minimize and optimize packages.
- New spatiotemporal techniques developed in <PhD thesis_>'_

Orbithunter uses NumPy <https://numpy.org/doc/>'_ and SciPy <https://www.scipy.org/docs.html>'_
for its numerical calculations. Its design emphasizes user-friendliness and modularity;
giving quick and easy access to high-level numerical operations.
Currently there is only an implementation of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation (KSE);
