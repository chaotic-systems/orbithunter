    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## A terse non-technical explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "Certain equations are hard to solve for two reasons: 1. the number of variables, 2. the relations between those variables.\n",
    "In fact, for a certain class of equations, nonlinear equations, there are seldom any exact solutions; they must\n",
    "be solved using computers. In certain settings this is hard, even for computers to manage, and so new tools\n",
    "must be developed. Orbithunter offers itself as one of these tools. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to do it\n",
    "\n",
    "By formulating turbulence as a space-time, variational formulation we can still find the same periodic orbits\n",
    "in the dynamical systems approach; however, spacetime affords us with new capabilities not seen elsewhere. such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The ability to find exponentially unstable solutions starting with modulated random noise\n",
    "- The ability to include spatiotemporal domain sizes to vary as free parameters; essentially allowing the equations to     determine the important scales (or \"learn\" in machine learning parlance). \n",
    "- The ability to cut and paste (quite literally) periodic orbits together in a manner that is both supported by theory\n",
    "  and also previously attempted in fluid dynamics research. "

    "those which manifest as time invariant sets, shape the geometry of the state-space by virtue of their stable\n",
    "and unstable manifolds. The instabilities, exponential in nature, prevent any long time prediction and are\n",
