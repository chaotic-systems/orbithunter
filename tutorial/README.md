# Notebooks

Won't be able to run these without the data I have, which is somewhat large and so only the
notebooks are included for viewing purposes. I have tried to comment and detail what I did thoroughly
but there is a lot here so confusion is expected. 

fill.ipynb :
Notebook testing the second iteration covering algorithms, 'filling' 

covering.ipynb : 
Notebook testing my original algorithm, that is deprecated since the implementation of the fill algorithm

shadowing.ipynb :
Notebook detailing how families were distinguished/determined and how they will be used in covering algorithms 

clipping.ipynb
How to extract subdomains out from orbits to use to find shadowing orbits 

continuation.ipynb
How to use numerical continuation to find same orbit on different tile size.  

convolutional_neural_networks.ipynb
A wrapper for some simply Keras CNNs for predictive purposes. 

fundamental_orbits.ipynb
How the set of orbits that comprise the symbolic alphabet 

gluing.ipynb
How to combine orbits together to use as initial conditions to find larger orbits. 

hunting.ipynb
Explanation of how to use numerical optimization methods, custom and SciPy made
to find orbits. 

persistent_homology
Examples of how to access the Gudhi persistent homology package via orbithunter api.

tutorial.ipynb
Summary of the package and its utilities
