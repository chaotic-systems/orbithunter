# Figures

This folder is where example figures and user-generated figures are stored by default.
The default format is .png, but this may be changed to any matplotlib supported file
type by passing a value for the key word argument 'extension' in the plotting function.
NOTE: File extensions need to include the period. 
e.g. extension='.pdf'

Each figure generated by the orbithunter .plot() method consists of a color coded spatiotemporal
scalar velocity field $u(x,t)$, wherein the vertical axis is time and horizontal axis is space. Because
of translational invariance, I elect to start both $x$ and $t$ at 0. The values of velocity field
are given by the color scale on the right. 

The implementation attempts to maintain a constant physical scale when plotting differently
sized orbits. I.e. if an orbit has a spatial dimension which is twice as long as another, this
should be reflected in the figure. 

Be warned: 
An issue that has plagued this convention is the plotting of small orbits. I believe it
has been handled by setting a minimum allowable figure size, but this means that the physical scale
is distorted as L, T -> 0.
