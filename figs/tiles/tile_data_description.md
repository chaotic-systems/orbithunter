The data in this folder is the velocity fields regularized by zero-padding.
This regularization is so that the fields all have the same number of points
while also having the correct spatial aspect ratios. The temporal periods
are approximated as being the same such that no padding is performed in the temporal
dimension. The antisymmetric orbit is the "wiggle" solution, the merger is the RelativeOrbit
and the streak is the equilibrium.
