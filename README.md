# orbithunter v0.4b3 (Beta)
-------------------------
orbithunter serves as a framework for solving chaotic nonlinear partial differential equations.

It provides:

- An object oriented approach to solutions of partial differential equations
- A general-purpose framework for finding, visualizing and manipulating these solutions
- High-level access to SciPy API, particularly its minimize and optimize packages.
- New spatiotemporal techniques developed by Matthew Gudorf

Orbithunter uses NumPy (https://numpy.org/doc/) and SciPy (https://www.scipy.org/docs.html)
for its numerical calculations. Its design emphasizes user-friendliness and modularity;
giving quick and easy access to high-level numerical operations.
Currently there is only an implementation of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation (KSE);
