# orbithunter Version 0.0
-------------------------
Framework for solving chaotic nonlinear PDEs in spatiotemporal manner.

# Introduction
--------------
This package enables the layman to solve nonlinear chaotic partial differential equations
by finding unstable periodic orbits by solving the spatiotemporal boundary value problem using
spatiotemporal Fourier modes (for KSE). 


PEP 8 and Refactoring
---------------------


To-do
-----
Neural networks for spatiotemporal symbolic dynamics classification
Create base "Orbit" class which can be subclassed for different equations other than the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation,
potentially. 
Create testing suite using a package i.e. unit testing.


Known Bugs and issues
