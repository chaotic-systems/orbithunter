orbithunter v0.0.0
----------------

Major changes
-------------
I am restarting the semantic versioning because the code has changed so much that the previous versions are in fact
not useful nor relevant anymore. 

1. New slicing and inplace operator inclusion. Clipping still has its utility but slicing is likely
much more convenient. Inplace operators will likely improve performance but that is left for later. 

2. Shadowing, covering, filling are new tools. Still testing Burak's algorithm, tentatively named the "fill" method.

3. Still adding more to notebooks and documentation. 

Notes
-----
The codes have evolved so much over the past 6 months or so that I am restarting the semantic versioning now that the foundation 
(core.py) is stable. This is fine as no one has adopted these codes as of yet due to the lack of a full release.
