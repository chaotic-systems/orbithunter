orbithunter v0.5b3
==================

.. currentmodule:: orbithunter

Minor Changes
-------------

- Renaming function arguments to abide by .rst  standards
- Reorganization of private methods in OrbitKS classes

Other
-----

- Large expansion of docs, I believe it merits a rough draft ready for `readthedocs <http://readthedocs.org/>`_
