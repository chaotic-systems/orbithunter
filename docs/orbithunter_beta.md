Major changes
-------------
Only because there has been no serious adoption by anyone, 
I am restarting the semantic versioning because the code has changed so much that the previous versions are in fact
not useful nor relevant anymore

1. shadowing.py 
   Contains cover, shadow, scan tools to calculate statistics of shadowing.

2. Removed 'hybrid' method from optimize. Now must call first then second method. It required too many
idiosyncratic considerations which caused more hassle than help.
