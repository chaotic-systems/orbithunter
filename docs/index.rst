Orbithunter v0.5b1 (Beta)

Framework for Solving Spatiotemporal PDEs
=========================================

orbithunter serves as a framework for solving chaotic nonlinear partial differential equations.


Features
--------

- An object oriented approach to solutions of partial differential equations
- A general-purpose framework for finding, visualizing and manipulating these solutions
- High-level access to SciPy API for usage with partial differential equations (and other). 
- New spatiotemporal techniques developed in `PhD thesis <https://github.com/mgudorf/orbithunter/blob/main/docs/spatiotemporal_tiling_of_the_KSe.pdf>`_

Orbithunter uses [NumPy]_ and [SciPy]_
for its numerical calculations. Its design emphasizes user-friendliness and modularity;
giving quick and easy access to high-level numerical operations

Special Thanks
--------------

I'd like to thank the open source projects [Networkx]_, [NumPy]_, [SciPy]_ and many other packages
for being great guides of how to setup, document, and structure Python packages, in addition to the great tools
they provide.
